# RNTypescript
Typescript in React Native

<h2>1. Define</h2>
<b>Typescript</b> is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language.
<h2>2. Benefits of Typescript</h2>
<h3>a. Typescript supports many types</h3>
You can use class, interface, type, basic data types (number, string, Date, boolean, array,...).
<h3>b. Typescript helps us avoid many errors in run-time</h3>
Example: in javascript you have this function to subtract 100 for a number
<pre>
function plusFive(num) {
  return num - 100;
}
</pre>
The exception will be generated if I pass a string instead of a number, and this exception only happens at run-time, too dangerous.
<h3>c. Easy to read, test, expand and maintain</h3>
<h3>d. Easy to apply OOP principles, SOLID principles, Design Patterns</h3>
<h3>e. One of the biggest advantages of TypeScript is its code completion and IntelliSense. Intellisense provides active hints as a code is added.</h3>
<h3>f. The ability to compile down to a version of JavaScript that runs on all browsers</h3>
